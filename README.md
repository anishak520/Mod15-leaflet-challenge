# Mod15-leaflet-challenge
using HTML, Javascript and Leaflet to create visualizations of earthquake data for the United States Geological Survey
### Background

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.


### Creating the Earthquake Visualizations
For this homework task, our objective was to generate a map using Leaflet that displays earthquake occurrences sourced from JSON data obtained from the USGS website. The markers on the map are designed to represent the earthquakes' magnitude through their size and the depth of the seismic activity through color variations. Specifically, earthquakes with higher magnitudes are depicted with larger markers, while those occurring at greater depths are indicated with darker shades.
